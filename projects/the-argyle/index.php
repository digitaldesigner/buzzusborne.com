			<p>Whilst working for Mentally Friendly, I was tasked with designing a classy, fashion-inspired blog for popular Sydney-based bar, The Argyle. Updated daily, the blog showcases the latest in Sydney style, fashion and events. In keeping with the bar itself; I designed the site to be edgy and eclectic.</p>
