			<h3>Project Title</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> The library of the application, which <a href="#">features</a> drag &amp; drop interactivity</p>
			
			<p>Prevue is an app that I've designed and built that lets designers share concepts with their clients. It's a simple tool, and one that serves 500k+ images to over 20k+ designers in almost 100 countries.</p>
			
			<p>It's a labour of love - and my own ongoing experiment in UI design and backend development.</p>
