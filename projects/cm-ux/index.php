			<h3>UX <em>/</em> Campaign Monitor</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> As two separate projects I re-designed the app header, and the core create/send UI</p>
			
			<p>Although my role at Campaign Monitor had typically involved <a href="../campmon/">art direction</a> and occasional <a href="../cm-digital/">digital design</a>, I've also had the chance to get my hands dirty with several large UX design projects (although I've never written a single line of production code).</p>
			
			<p>I enjoy the tougher, large-scale UX problems and tend to gravitate towards projects that involve integrating new or existing features into much larger workflows. For example, I re-designed the entire create &amp; send workflow at the heart of the Campaign Monitor product, and also designed a new header - the first step towards an app-wide visual update.</p>

			<h5>Canvas</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> Sketching and conceptual development</p>			
			<p>One of the largest UX projects I've worked on was a product called <a href="http://canvas.cm" target="_blank">Canvas</a>; a drag and drop tool that enables customers to easily build HTML emails. Unlike the existing products in the market, I set out to design a simple interface that let the user see their finished creation (WYSIWYG) without unnecessary UI getting in the way.</p>
			
			<p>To achieve this, and to design something that we could build on over time - I set out to create a visual language, rather than jumping straight into the glossy UI. By designing guidelines like <em>"blue means draggable"</em>, I was aiming to create a product that felt tactile, playful and natural.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> The main Canvas interface, and various individual UI elements</p>
			
			<p>Even back in the concept and architecture stages of the project, I was clear that to stand out from the competition, we needed to focus on ease-of-use. Designing emails had to fun, not complicated. To help guide my decisions, I wrote the following intentions before starting design:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>A beautiful and well-built email is the only acceptable outcome - regardless of content</li>
				<li>Adding and editing content should be intuitive</li>
				<li>At all points, the email should look as close to its finished state as possible. Unnecessary presentation interface controls and architecture should be avoided</li>
				<li>The interface should be preemptive of the various ways users add and interact with content, not prescriptive</li>
				<li>Content should be automatically formatted and presented in the best possible way</li>
				<li>Avoid presenting the user with errors - instead, do what we assume they were trying to achieve</li>
				<li>We should not expect a higher than necessary level of technical understanding from users</li>
				<li>The interface should operate seamlessly without knowledge of drag and drop capability</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Though I was responsible for the original concept, architecture and design of Canvas â€“ the front-end coding, animation and backend implementation was handled by an extremely talented in-house team.</p>
