			<h3>Campaign Monitor</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> Letter-pressed business cards, part of the stationary set I designed</p>			
			<p>I'm currently the Head of Design at <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com">Campaign Monitor</a>, where I've been the design lead since 2011. In that time I've had the opportunity to personally design on a number of varied briefs – from print to digital. Below is a selection of my favorite print, branding and iconography work.</p>
			
			<p>Originally responsible for a major re-branding of the company, I've ensured the visual consistency of the brand, both internal and external – aiming for an unmistakable "Campaign Monitor" style throughout everything we produce, digital or otherwise.</p>
			
			<div class="image border under"><img src="files/marque.png" alt="The Campaign Monitor marque" height="317" /></div>
							
			<p>In addition to the public branding of the company and extension of the visual isometric style (above), I've also produced a number of brands for internal projects (below). Apparel for a company offsite to Fiji, and development platform called Reckless, and our internal "Ship It" day are some examples of these projects.</p>

			<h3>Iconography</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below:</strong> A set of iOS7-style icons for the Campaign Monitor iPhone app</p>
			<p>I make no secret of my love for iconography – for me, custom icons are as much an extension of a brand as UI or typography. Over the course of my time at Campaign Monitor I designed a number of icon sets for various purposes, each one aiming for a unique style, specific to where they're going to be used.</p>
			
			<div class="image under"><img src="files/iphone_close.png" /></div>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below:</strong> Various icon styles, for both marketing and UI</p>
				
			<p>I produced an icon set for the iOS7-inspired Campaign Monitor iPhone app in 2014 (above and below). The following icons were also produced as individual sets, and used for various marketing materials (left) and for a drag &amp; drop UI (right).</p>

			<h3>Print</h3>

			<p>Finally, calling on experience from earlier in my career I've had the opportunity to produce a number of printed items – books, posters, ads and stationary to name just a few.</p>

			<p>The below was a limited edition poster of the popular (though incredibly ugly) CSS <a href="https://i3.campaignmonitor.com/assets/files/css/campaign-monitor-guide-to-css-in-email-sep-2013V2.pdf">spreadsheet</a>. This infographic-style A1 poster was given to 1,000 customers in a competition giveaway in 2013.</p>
