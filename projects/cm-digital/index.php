			<h3>Digital <em>/</em> Campaign Monitor</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> I designed and coded a complete re-design of the website. <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com/">Visit the site</a></p>
				
			<p>As Head of Design at <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com">Campaign Monitor</a>, the majority of work I direct is digital. Over the course of my time at Campaign Monitor, I've also designed a number of digital projects myself.</p>
			
			<p>Most significantly, I was the sole designer behind the total re-design of the company website in 2012. In addition to concept and architecture, I designed and coded the 200-page strong website and blog. I continue to manage the site, and evolve the visual style through art directing a team of digital designers.</p>
			
			<p class="inline caption">Though some designs shown here were designed 3+ years apart, the site still maintains a consistent visual style. Interestingly, the current version of the site was released a year before "flat design" was a recognized term.</p>

			<p class="half">Digital designers also code at Campaign Monitor, a tough requirement, but one that's helped the site maintain the sites' quality and attention to detail with a relatively small team.</p>
			
			<p class="half">In addition to designing and launching sites like <a href="http://canvas.cm">Canvas</a>, I've also had the chance to develop my own skills in JavaScript and responsive design.</p>
						
			<p class="caption half"><strong>Left:</strong> The landing page I designed and built for a feature release in June 2014 - a fully responsive site which also uses an AJAX signup form <strong>(above)</strong></p>
			
			<p class="half">In the interest of keeping front-end development simple, scalable and secure for a site of this size â€“ all landing pages like Canvas, and most pages on the Campaign Monitor domain are built on a PHP template framework that I created.</p>
			<p class="half">Amongst other benefits, it enables other digital designers to code and deploy their own projects without worrying about technical complexity.</p>

			<h3>Art Direction</h3>
				
			<p>In addition to hands-on digital work, I've also had the pleasure of working alongside several video and animation agencies (such as <a href="http://versusmedia.com.au/">Versus</a>, above) and a range of contractors whilst art directing a number of content pieces for Campaign Monitor.</p>
