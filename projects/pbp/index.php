			<h3>Postbox Party</h3>

			<p>Postbox Party is a small setup in the UK run by a close friend - it's a company that creates bespoke handmade party boxes for various occasions. The company's primary way of selling was online, so I designed and built their website - which aimed to reflect the fun and homemade nature of their products in the design.</p>

			<h5>A custom Shopify theme</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> A product page, managed by the Shopify CMS</p>
			<p>I built the site as a custom <a href="http://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> theme – which enabled the client to fully manage all parts of the site. I designed the site to have a very tactile and home-made feel, whilst also being functional.</p>
			<p>The site underwent a significant amount of testing and re-design to achieve this tricky mix of home-made and functional – a theme which is carried out through all parts of the e-commerce process.</p>
