			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> Some of the most recognisable icons used throughout Skype</p>
			
			<p>Working in-house with the Skype design teams in London and Estonia, I designed the icon suite currently used in all Skype applications - including their <a href="http://skype.com">global website</a> and iPhone app.</p>
			
			<p>The brief was to design a family of icons that were recognisably Skype, and were scalable enough to work across multiple platforms and sizes.</p>

			<p class="caption half"><strong>Left:</strong> Strict restrictions were placed on minimum radius size, points of angle and grid alignment</p>
