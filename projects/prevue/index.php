			<h3>Prevue</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> The drag-and-drop enabled library with projects and groups</p>
			
			<p>Prevue is an app that I founded in 2007. It's a web-based product that lets designers and agencies share design concepts with their clients. Based on a freemium model, the product currently serves 500k+ images to over 20k designers worldwide.</p>
			<p>As the sole designer, frontend and backend developer - Prevue serves as my own personal experiment in UX and product marketing. What I learn from running my own app helps influence what I do in <a href="../campmon/">my day job</a>.</p>

			<h5>Minimal UI</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> The Prevue homepage which was a result of an extensive A/B experiment</p>			
			<p>Prevue has been my own personal experiment in minimal design - every interaction and UI element has been designed to ensure the uploaded work of the user is the most important aspect of each page.</p>
			<p>The application has been developed to be extremely fast and responsive (<a href="http://blog.prevue.it/posts/speed-matters">read more</a>), and where possible utilises drag and drop to give the app a native feel on desktop, iPad and retina displays.</p>

			<p class="half">I've also designed and built a number of tracking tools and CRM applications to manage Prevue - which has become increasingly important to handle the volume of support and feautre requests as the product has grown.</p>
			
			<p class="half">One of the most useful tools I've built has been a custom CMS, which I use to get a high-level view of daily account activity. The app, left, shows the most recent signups and gives an insight into user behaviour by outlining some of the most popular features and projects for each customer.</p>
			
			<p class="caption half"><strong>Left:</strong> The feed for an individual user account using my own CMS app. Since I do almost all reporting and support via my phone, I decided to build a mobile-first content management system.</p>
			
			<p class="half">Prevue is a constantly evolving application, which updates to meet the requirements of the people who use it. For more information, <a href="http://signup.prevue.it/">create an account</a> or read <a href="http://blog.prevue.it/">the blog</a>.</p>
