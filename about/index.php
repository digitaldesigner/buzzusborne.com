			<p class="lead">I spend my days as Principal Designer for <a href="https://www.helpscout.com">Help Scout</a> &mdash; where I work remotely from a tiny surf town on the East coast of Australia. I also coach design teams, advise startups and ocassionally write about design. Out of office hours you'll find me on the beach with my wife and son.</p>
			
			<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about solving tough customer problems by combining thoughtful research, clever technology and beautiful design. I&rsquo;ve previously contributed to, and led design teams at Atlassian, Campaign Monitor, Skype, Sendle and a number of start-ups and agencies in Europe and Australia. Above all else, I enjoy helping design teams do their best work.</p>

			<p>I enjoy working with tech teams to produce amazing visual solutions to tough customer-centric problems. I like to see projects from concept through to completion, and love getting my hands dirty &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s through talking with customers, crafting beautiful visual design, coding prototypes, or by mentoring others to achieve great results.</p>

			<p>I also created <a href="https://prevue.it/" target="_blank">Prevue</a>, a design presentation tool used by over 30,000 design agencies to share concepts and gather client feedback &mdash; a product I built and managed for over 10 years until it was acquired in 2018. The experience of designing, building and growing a profitable product has provided me with an invaluable opportunity to understand the role of design in a business. Prevue has also given me a platform to experiment with UI, UX and product strategy &mdash; which has given me the insight and experience to better perform in my full-time roles.</p>

			<p>Prior to moving to Australia, I spent a number of years in London working for a variety of different companies over a multitude of disciplines. Most notably I worked as a Product Design Lead for Skype, where I designed their current <a href="../casestudy/<?=$manifest['skype']['path']?>">app iconography</a> and the UI for their <a href="../casestudy/<?=$manifest['skype_business']['path']?>">business tools</a>. Prior to that, I held positions at several large digital and advertising agencies where I worked alongside a number of world-class designers and directors, designing more blogs and fashion ecommerce sites than I can recall. It was during this time that I developed my love of code and design thinking, which ultimately pushed me to a career in tech.</p>

			<p>Before designing full-time, I was a competitive sailor and professional dinghy racing coach living in the Mediterranean. My mind is never too far from the ocean, and I appreciate the importance of a healthy work/life balance. So when I&rsquo;m not online, you&rsquo;ll find me outdoors &mdash; riding motorbikes, swimming, sand running or travelling.</p>
