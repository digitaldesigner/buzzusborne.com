			<h3>About.</h3>			
			<p class="lead">I&rsquo;m a Product Designer and Creative Director living in Sydney, Australia. I&rsquo;m deeply passionate about problem solving and enjoy varied, challenging digital work.</p>
			
			<p>I enjoy listening to real people, watching their habits and understanding their frustrations &mdash; then creating beautiful and useful product experiences that meet their needs and exceed their expectations.</p>
				
			<p>Having spent over a decade working for agencies and startups, I&rsquo;ve been responsible for producing award-winning UX and UI design as part of the <a href="../casestudy/skype/">Skype</a>, Microsoft and <a href="../casestudy/campaignmonitor/">Campaign Monitor</a> product teams. And as a Digital Designer, I&rsquo;ve designed on behalf of clients such as Agent Provocateur, Johnson & Johnson, Toni&Guy and E*Trade. In addition to extensive design experience, I also have a proven track record of building and leading highly successful creative teams &mdash; most recently as the UX Director for Campaign Monitor.</p>
			
			<p>I am also the Founder and Product Design Lead of <a href="../casestudy/prevue/">Prevue.it</a> &mdash; a product used by over 25,000 design agencies to share design concepts and gather quick client feedback. In addition to unparalleled customer interaction, the experience of building a profitable and sustainable business has taught me how to continually push the boundaries of a project, whilst working within limited technical scope and harsh financial constraints.</p>

			<p>My passion is finding visual solutions to tough problems &mdash; not design, or following trends for the sake of it. Instead, I enjoy researching, concepting, validating, and executing solutions in whatever form best suits the brief &mdash; from stunning visual design and clear copywriting, to clever technical innovation and subtle interaction. It&rsquo;s my pursuit of problem solving that has seen me in a variety of design roles, from print through to UX.</p>

			<hr />

			<p>Previously a competitive sailor and professional coach, I appreciate the importance of a healthy work<em class="special">/</em>life balance. When I'm not in front of a computer you'll likely find me outdoors &mdash; riding motorbikes, swimming, running or traveling.</p>
