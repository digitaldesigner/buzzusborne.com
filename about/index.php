			<h3>About.</h3>			
			<p class="lead">I am a Digital Designer and Creative Director living in Sydney, Australia. With a passion for problem solving – I enjoy varied, challenging digital work.</p>

			<p>I have been responsible for producing award-winning UX and UI design as part of the Skype, Microsoft and Campaign Monitor product teams. And as a Digital Designer working in agencies on behalf of clients such as Agent Provocateur, Johnson & Johnson, Toni&Guy and E*Trade.</p>

			<p>I am an excellent communicator with a passion for creativity and technical innovation. Well-versed in running a project from concept through to completion, I not only have experience in design but a proven track record of building and leading highly successful creative teams – most recently as the UX Director for <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com">Campaign Monitor</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>But most of all</strong>... I enjoy listening to real people, watching their habits, then creating beautiful and useful product experiences that meet their needs and exceed their expectations.</p>

			<p>In pursuit of user-driven design, have also founded and managed several profitable products, most significantly as the Founder of <a href="https://prevue.it/">Prevue</a> &mdash; a product built and run solely by myself, and used by over 20,000 agencies to share design concepts with clients. In addition to unparalleled customer interaction, the experience of running a business has taught me how to continually push the boundaries of a project whilst also working within limited technical scope and harsh financial constraints.</p>

			<p>Previously a competitive sailor and professional coach, I appreciate the importance of a healthy work/life balance. When I'm not in front of a computer you'll likely find me outdoors - riding motorbikes, swimming, running or travelling.</p>
