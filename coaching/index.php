			<h3 class="spacer--xlarge">Virtual coffee</h3>
			<p>I love meeting designers and people across the tech industry &mdash; having broad conversations and sharing experiences with likeminded individuals is a big part of what helps me grow. Wanna jump on a video call, talk shop and share stories? I promise to be transparent, open and honest.</p>

			<h3 class="spacer--xlarge">Coaching</h3>
			<p>I liaise 1-to-1 with designers and team leads to help individuals grow personally and professionally in their roles. In some cases this happens in one-off calls, other times over weekly sessions that span multiple years. Through understanding the motivations, goals and challenges facing the people I coach, I deeply enjoy helping unlock success in whatever form that might take.</p>

			<h3 class="spacer--xlarge">Consulting</h3>
			<p>I work with tech companies to help understand the gaps in their design capabilities, and identify the types of people, processes and structures necessary to help deliver their long term goals. Often that involves writing job descriptions to attract top talent, coaching existing teams, interviewing candidates or providing ongoing support. Sometimes I just explain the difference between UX and UI.</p>
			<p>I don't recruit, but where possible I will help connect awesome companies with awesome people.</p>
			<p>I've worked with some of the fastest growing B2B and B2C SaaS companies here in Australia and the US, across a variety of industries &mdash; including not-for-profit, education, fintech and healthcare.</p>

			<h3 class="spacer--xlarge">Speaking</h3>
			<p>I talk candidly about the challenges and benefits of remote teams, building and implementing design systems, establishing happy and creative teams, and my own experiences starting and selling my own startup.</p>
