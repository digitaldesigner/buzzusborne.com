			<h1>Making Small Changes.</h1>
			<p class="lead">Much like you I&rsquo;m sure, the news stresses me out &mdash; and browsing the internet just makes things worse. It&rsquo;s caused me to start thinking about my own impact on the world &mdash; what I can do more of, less of, and how to build a better, happier and more sustainable future for my child&rsquo;s generation.</p>
			
			<p>I firmly believe that the best way to enact positive change is by starting at home &mdash; instead of being overwhelmed trying to make huge global impact. If we can all make small dents in our own worlds, then we can achieve big things. I see it more as a <span class="texter">sphere of influence</span>, and this is mine.</p>			
			
			<p class="highlight"><strong>You should know...</strong> this is my own personal list, it&rsquo;s what holds me accountable and only applicable to my little family of 3 living in rural Australia. I also need to acknowledge my own privilege &mdash; I have the money, circumstances and time to make these changes. Your mileage may vary.</p>

			<h2>Social Good</h2>
			<p>The theme here is to <strong>be good</strong>. Be nice to people, support others, help those around you to succeed and inspire others to do the same.</p>
			
			<h3>Work with, and for ethical and socially-minded companies.</h3>
			<p>All my full-time employers for the past 8 years have had ethical and social policies and have "given back" in some capacity. My current employer is a <a href="https://bcorporation.com.au/">B-Corp</a>, as was a previous employer. I work with companies who value diversity &mdash; and who already demonstrate significant effort in building an equal opportunity business.</p> 
			
			<p>I will only take freelance contracts for businesses who represent social good &mdash; for example, one recent client provides education to kids in Nairobi, another helps people with disabilities in Australia. I want to know that by helping companies to be successful, I will be indirectly helping others.</p>
									
			<h3 class="spacer--large">Raise-up those around you.</h3>
			<p>I want to help others be better, and I&rsquo;m fortunate to have a platform to do so. I recognize that being a white man has helped me tremendously in my career, and whilst I can&rsquo;t change that, I can use my voice to help others who haven&rsquo;t been afforded such advantages. I take every opportunity to recommend less-represented people within my industry for talks, freelance opportunities and interviews when they are offered to me.</p>
			<p>If someone is doing something great, ambitious, brave &mdash; support them, or get out their way. The world doesn&rsquo;t need another voice saying "no". I mentor and coach individuals who need a leg-up, and encourage others to do the same. Within reason, I will never decline the opportunity to give advice and make connections on behalf of somebody who asks for it.</p>
			<p><span class="texter">Pay it forward.</span></p>
						
			<h3 class="spacer--large">Don&rsquo;t use exclusionary language.</h3>
			<p>The word "guys" excludes women in a group. The word "crazy" is demeaning to people who may suffer from mental illness ("bananas" and "wild" are good substitutes). Don&rsquo;t chuck the word "gay" around unless referring to people who identify as such. Obviously don&rsquo;t be racist. It&rsquo;s easy... if a word or saying has the potential to make someone feel shitty, then don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
						
			<h3 class="spacer--large">Don&rsquo;t support bad people or bad habits.</h3>
			<p>I believe that if you support bad people, even indirectly, you&rsquo;re complicit in their actions. For example we recently took a quote from a cleaning company who, when visiting, started using racial and derogatory terms. I won&rsquo;t do business with someone like that. Whilst I can (and do) call people out on their bad habits, I also recognize that I can&rsquo;t change them... but at the very least I can stop supporting them.</p>
						
			<h3 class="spacer--large">Be mindful of the businesses you support.</h3>
			<p>It turns out there are a lot of companies who treat their employees poorly, or support really bad things. For me, it&rsquo;s important to make smart choices about companies I use... like buying <a href="https://www.newbalance.com.au/inside-nb-philanthropy.html">New Balance</a> instead of Nike, Lyft instead of Uber, <a href="https://thankyou.co/global-impact">Thankyou</a> instead of Unilever and just avoiding Facebook all-together.</p>
			
			<p>I think it&rsquo;d be extreme to research every company you use, but if there&rsquo;s an obvious ethical choice &mdash; use them instead. Likewise if you find that a brand is bad, then refer to the previous point.</p>
			
			<h3 class="spacer--large">Support the creative arts.</h3>
			<p>Art is great, it&rsquo;s an expression of self &mdash; it makes us human, individual and happy. I support it wherever possible, especially when friends or family follow creative pursuits. I will buy your art, donate to your short film, listen to your music, participate in your class. Fuck yes to more artistic expression in the world!</p>

			<h3>Be an informed voter.</h3>
			<p>I too have lost faith with politicians and democracy as a whole... but that doesn&rsquo;t mean voting isn&rsquo;t important. There will always be people who vote for bad politicians who promote bad policy &mdash; your vote is required to balance the scales. Don&rsquo;t vote for single topics, even if that means voting against your own self interest (taxes, for example). Vote for parties, their collective agenda and for anyone who represents long-term prosperity.</p>

			<h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
			<p class="lead">Our collective impact on our ecosystem and climate have reached a critical mass whereby nothing seems like enough to repair the damage done. But by affecting change at home, at least I can look my son in the eyes and say that we did everything we could to lessen our impact on the environment. The aim here is to live as close to <strong>carbon neutral</strong> as possible.</p>
						
			<h3>We don&rsquo;t over-consume.</h3>
			<p>Everything we buy, we buy with a purpose. We rent and borrow a lot of things that have short shelf-lives, and we often buy from charity and antique stores. This also applies to food, we use what we have, don&rsquo;t allow food to go bad and try not to throw much away.</p>
						
			<h3 class="spacer--large">Recycle everything that can be.</h3>
			<p>Anything that can&rsquo;t be recycled is either up-cycled and donated. A good example is the last two times we moved house, we did it with zero-waste... absolutely nothing was thrown to landfill.</p>
			
			<p>We absolutely don&rsquo;t buy single-use plastics &mdash; that means no cling-wrap, shopping bags or plastic toys. We also buy products with this in mind and only use providers who have a commitment to zero-waste, like <a href="https://www.hellofresh.com.au/recycle-your-hellofresh-packaging/">Hello Fresh</a>.</p>
						
			<h3 class="spacer--large">We&rsquo;re mindful of our carbon footprint.</h3>
			<p>We live in a remote community, which means we use the car... which is bad, I know. But we only make necessary journeys, and offset 200% the amount of carbon we burn through donations to the <a href="https://cncf.com.au/">CNFC</a>. Aside from that we use trains, busses, walk and cycle wherever possible.</p>
			<p>We also make every effort to conserve energy at home. We don&rsquo;t use much A/C, we don&rsquo;t have heating, our hot water is heated by solar, and all our lights are energy efficient (and automated to turn off when not in use).</p>
			
			<h3 class="spacer--large">We make ethical food choices.</h3>
			<p>Whilst we do eat meat we try to eat vegetarian at least once a week. Produce we buy is always the highest quality, ethically sourced, and chemical-free. We buy Australian produce and shop local as much as possible. We even started a little veggie patch, let&rsquo;s see how that goes.</p>
