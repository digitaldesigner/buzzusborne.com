			<p class="lead">I'm Buzz, a Product Designer. I design end-to-end experiences that customers love to use &mdash; I see projects from problem statement through to delivery and everything in-between. I also mentor designers, advise startups, and advocate for collaborative and inclusive design wherever I can.</p>
			<p>Having spent a number of years in management and team leadership positions, I've since followed my passion back to being an IC (indipendent contributor) &mdash; where I seriously love sweating the details, talking to customers, producing prototypes and talking shop. I work remotely from a tiny surf town in East Australia.</p>

			<h3>Principal Designer</h3>
			<p><strong><a href="#" class="chilled">Help Scout</a></strong>, 2018&ndash;19</p>
			<p class="smoosh">Help Scout is an incredibly talented crew of remote designers, engineers, writers and customer champs who build simple, beautiful tools that help businesses provide amazing customer support of their own. Every design decision comes down to how we can help companies provide better support to their own customers... a mission statement close to my heart.</p>
			
			<p class="highlight"><strong>Also...</strong><br /><br />I work with start-ups in an advisory capacity to help grow and improve their design team capabilities. Working directly with Founders and Leadership Teams, I help identify the type of structures, processes and skills necessary to scale design within their business. Whilst I have no involvement in the recruitment efforts, I typically write job descriptions, advise on how to target top talent, vet applicants and coach interviewers in how to identify favorable qualities and potential risks.</p>
			
			<h3 class="spacer-small">Founder</h3>
			<p><strong><a href="#" class="chilled">Prevue</a></strong>, 2010&ndash;18</p>
			<p class="smoosh">Long story short&hellip; I created an online tool to share design concepts with clients and get feedback. I learned how to code and did the designer-turned-developer thing for over a decade &mdash; eventually building Prevue into the design sharing platform for over 30,000 agencies worldwide. Running as a highly-profitable subscription business, I sold the company in 2018 when my son was born.</p>

			<h3>Atlassian</h3>
			<p class="caption">Lead Designer, 2016&ndash;17</p>
			<p class="smoosh">My primary role at Atlassian was to help progress the visual craft standard of the globally distributed design team. This involved mentoring, education, facilitating design discovery and helping designers develop and sell conceptual improvements at a company scale. My role also involved a healthy split of hands-on visual design, specifically on JIRA where I worked on concepts, UI, user testing and prototyping.</p>
			
			<h3>Sendle.com</h3>
			<p class="caption">Product Lead, 2015&ndash;16</p>
