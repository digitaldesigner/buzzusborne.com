			<h2>Prevue.it</h2>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> The Library screen. A drag-and-drop UI that allows upload and collection of work into projects and groups</p>
			<p>In 2007 I built an app that let me share fullscreen design concepts with my clients, organise my work, and allow my images to be annotated with feedback. Today, that app is used by 20,000 designers and agencies to share over 1 million designs with their own clients.</p>
			<p>Though still designed, built and run entirely by myself - Prevue now operates as a profitable business, and a playground for my experimentations in UX, UI and code. Above all else, Prevue provides me with unparallelled experience in feature management, customer communication and product strategy.</p>

			<h5>Minimal UI</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> Some small parts of the UI where special attention has been paid to the details</p>			
			<p>Prevue has been my own personal experiment in UX/UI - every interaction, element and animation has been designed to ensure the product is as efficient and intuitive as possible.</p>
			<p>Similar attention has been paid to the quality of the codebase, which is optimised for speed and performance (<a href="http://blog.prevue.it/posts/speed-matters">read more</a>), and utilises drag &amp; drop functionality to give the app a native feel on desktop, iPad and retina.</p>
			<p><a href="https://medium.com/@buzzusborne/god-is-in-the-details-bc3a9a9a5d88">&#8220;God is in the details&#8221;</a> is an article I wrote about the importance of the details in UX &amp; UI, specifically relating to my work on Prevue.</p>

			<h5>Marketing &amp; Optimisation</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> The Prevue homepage, which features in-page signup and a Javascript "video" tour</p>			
			<p>In addition to the product itself, I also spend a great deal of effort on Marketing &mdash; which could be A/B testing the <a href="https://prevue.it/">homepage</a>, writing for the <a href="https://blog.prevue.it/">blog</a> and sending regular email marketing.</p>
			<p>This side of the business has also been a good opportunity to experiment with conversion optimisation and lead-nurturing, all of which I measure using a bespoke CMS I built for Prevue.</p>
