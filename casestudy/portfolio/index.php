			<h2><?php echo (date('Y') - 2009); ?> years ago&hellip;</h2>
			<p>I was a fresh-faced 25 year old designer in London, looking for work in the software industry. So I did what any digital designer did back then, I printed my web work and put it in a big leather-bound portfolio. The following is the work that landed my job at Skype and has been hidden away under the spare bed ever since.</p>
			
			<h5>Russian Standard (&lsquo;09)</h5>
			<p>I designed a pitch website for Russian Standard vodka, which never saw the light of day. I was fond of this because the client provided me with zero assets and only 48 hours to come up with something creative. They did, however, give me a crate of vodka as &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo;.</p>

			<h5>Duchy Originals (&lsquo;09)</h5>
			<p>I worked on this site with then-colleague-now-famous-DJ, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=russ+chimes">Russ Chimes</a>. It won a bunch of awards largely because it was a fully custom eCommerce build &mdash; which in 2009 was a huge deal. The launch party was hosted by Prince Charles at some Royal residence. I wasn&rsquo;t invited.</p>

			<div class="image half right"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/portfolio/duchy-02.jpg" width="100%"></div>
			
			
			
			<h5>Sam &amp; Buzz (&lsquo;08)</h5>
			<p>My wife and I went travelling around Australia, so I made an interactive website to help our family know where we&rsquo;d be on any particular date. I think it was based on Wordpress and had a basic commenting system.</p>
			<p>Bizarelly this opened the most doors for me &mdash; it was something a bit different and just for fun, but was a good demonstration of the type of work I wanted to be doing.</p>

			<h5>Eden Project (&lsquo;07)</h5>
			<p>I was particularly proud of this because it was amongst my first digital briefs. It was a pitch that was later rejected, but I recall pulling it together in a couple of days. Judging from the illustrations I was clearly unaware that women or PoC existed. This design is from a time where tag clouds were a big draw-card for blogs, and blogs were a very complicated thing to pull off.</p>

			<div class="image half right"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/portfolio/eden-02.jpg" width="100%"></div>



			<h5>Shop (&lsquo;07)</h5>
			<p>This was a fashion blog to accompnay a magazine my agency was also involved in. I don't recall much about this brief, other than things appearing &ldquo;above the fold&rdquo; was very much a priority in this era. This design represented my attempts to aggrivate front-end developers with near impossible layouts, photographic content and custom fonts &mdash; which again was non-trivial in 2007.</p>
			<p>The developer responsible for building these designs now works as one of the engineering leads at Spotify, which makes total sense.</p>

			<h5>Print work (&lsquo;06)</h5>
			<p>The day after graduating I started working at a tiny graphic design agency where I worked as one of 4 designers. I did plenty of print and branding work, but the below were significant because they were my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; client projects. A recipe booklet and a wine pairing guide.</p>
			<p>I recall excusing myself after recieving the first brief and having a full panic attack in the a gency bathrooms. I had no idea how to operate any of the print software (Quark Xpress) the agency wanted me to use. I learned fast.</p>

			<h5>And finally&hellip;</h5>
			
			<p>One evening in 2006 a client phoned to ask whether I could do a &ldquo;quick photorealistic mockup&rdquo; of what commemorative plates and mugs might look like if Prince William and his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton ever got engaged. Little did I know that the client would leak said mockups to the press, making headlines in every tabloid and sparking speculation that a royal wedding was afoot.</p>
			<p>I got accused of being the leak (I&rsquo;d never leak such terrible design work). They didn&rsquo;t get engaged for another 4 years.</p>
