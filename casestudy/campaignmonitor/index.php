			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> My design team</p>
			<p>I was the Creative Director for the Digital Design team at Campaign Monitor. Over the course of 3 years, I designed the brand, site and set the visual tone for all global marketing. During this time I had my hand in all areas of design, from print and advertising through to art direction and development.</p>
			<p>Focussing on giving the company a more &lsquo;human&rsquo; and modern feel, I designed the brand that Campaign Monitor uses today. Starting with the logo, I worked with typographer <a href="http://studioanthonylane.com/" target="_blank">Anthony Lane</a> to produce an identity that could be extended to our marketing efforts, both online and off.</p>

			<p>One of my primary goals with the brand was to create a friendly and approachable image, whilst also remaining a respected leader in the field. <strong>Tone of voice</strong> played a big part in helping to achieve this &mdash; a playful tone can be seen in advertising.</p>
			
			<div class="image under"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/campaignmonitor/print_ad.jpg" width="100%"></div>
			
			<p>I also aimed to reinforce the playful, fun and human nature of the brand in supporting collateral &mdash; and always aimed to support the design community where possible. Here's how we played with the logo to produce a series of branded giveaway's.</p>

			<h5>Digital Marketing</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> Note</p>			
			<p>I was also responsible for the total redesign and re-build of the Campaign Monitor website, a 200+ page site that spans product marketing, blog and documentation. Launched at a similar time to the new logo, the site serves as an extension of the brand &mdash; friendly though a clear leader in the field.</p>
