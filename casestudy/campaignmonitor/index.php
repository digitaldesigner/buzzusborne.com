			<h5>The Brief</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> The full logo featured in Campaign Monitor's Sydney offices in 2015</p>
			<p>One of my first jobs as Creative Director at Campaign Monitor was to consider the long term brand image of the company. At the time, the logo and website didn't reflect the core values of the business, or the future plans of the product &mdash; my brief was to give the brand a &ldquo;refresh&rdquo;.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> The old logo</p>
			<p>Campaign Monitor is a company with world-class customer support at their core, so one of the main things I wanted to achieve was to bring a more &lsquo;human&rsquo; feel to the brand. I needed to represent the product as a respectable market leader, but there was definitely room to give everything a touch of fun and personality.</p>

			<p>Starting with the logo, I designed an identity that could be extended to all marketing efforts, both online and off. This meant designing both an &lsquo;icon&rsquo;, and typographic word-mark that could be used both paired, and on their own. I worked closely with typographer <a href="http://studioanthonylane.com/" target="_blank">Anthony Lane</a> to create a typographic logo that was legible, but also had a softer touch.</p>

			<h5>Brand Application</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> Various applications of the brand</p>			
			<p>Tone of voice played a big part in positioning the company a respected leader in the field &mdash; we needed to be seen as relatable, approachable and friendly, but not childish or flippant.</p>
			<p>To support this message, I wrote simple and relatable copy to be used on advertising and merchandise, commissioned local artists to &ldquo;interpret&rdquo; the logo, and produced internal extensions of the brand (below).</p>

			<h5>Website Design</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> A few of the original designs for the global marketing site</p>			
			<p>I was also tasked with a total redesign of the company website, a 200+ page content-heavy site that spans product marketing, blog and documentation. It was a great opportunity to extend the brand, and used bright colours and friendly copy to reinforce the core brand values.</p>
			
			<p>I built the site on a custom PHP framework of my own design &mdash; which gave the ability to use multiple templates, whilst remaining flexible and scalable. The constantly-evolving site receives over 5 million unique visits a year, and remains true to my original designs today.</p>
