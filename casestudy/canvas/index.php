			<h5>The Brief</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> An immersive, design-led email builder that has the feel of a native website builder</p>
			<p>One of the biggest challenges for designers and marketers is the complexity involved in building HTML email templates. Coding mobile-responsive emails that work cross-browser is difficult&hellip; but making them look good too is next to impossible.</p>
			
			<p>There are existing tools, but all of them provide create cookie-cutter templates and hard-to-use interfaces. <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com" target="_blank">Campaign Monitor</a> saw an opportunity to do better.</p>
			
			<p>In what was one of the most challenging tasks of my career, I was tasked with designing an easy way for anyone to design a beautiful, bespoke email that matches their brand, works everywhere, and doesn&rsquo;t require a knowledge of HTML.</p>

			<p class="info"><strong>Above/</strong> Some of the core functionality, drag <em class="special amp">&amp;</em> drop content tiles</p>			
			<p>After researching existing products in the market, and other similar tools like website and blog creators - I saw that most tools were simply passing complexity onto the user. As a point of difference, I wanted to create a simple interface that let the user see their finished creation without unnecessary UI getting in the way. I wanted to focus on ease-of-use, and produce a product that felt intuitive, fun and native.</p>
			
			<p>Starting with a lot of sketching, I set out to create an experience that didn't require much UI - one that only showed controls and prompts when the user absolutely needed them.</p>
			
			<div class="image half"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/canvas/sketch_01.jpg" /></div>
			<div class="image half right"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/canvas/sketch_02.jpg" /></div>
			<div class="image half close under"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/canvas/sketch_03.jpg" /></div>
			<div class="image half right close under"><img class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-src="../_images/canvas/sketch_04.jpg" /></div>
			
			<p>Through sketching, research and wireframing I formed a simple set of design &lsquo;intentions&rsquo; &mdash; which I planned to use as my guidelines in the UI stages of the project:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>A beautiful and well-built email is the only acceptable outcome &mdash; regardless of content</li>
				<li>Adding and editing content should be native, and intuitive</li>
				<li>At all points, the email should look as close to its finished state as possible. Unnecessary presentation interface controls and architecture should be avoided</li>
				<li>The UI should be preemptive of the various ways users add and interact with content, not prescriptive</li>
				<li>Avoid presenting the user with errors - instead, do what we assume they were trying to achieve</li>
				<li>We should not expect a higher than necessary level of technical understanding from users. So the interface should operate seamlessly without knowledge of drag and drop capability</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h5>Designing a visual language</h5 >
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> The UI takes cues from native applications and existing WYSIWYG editors</p>			
			<p>The visual design, whilst minimal, was designed to be scalable and adapt to the future plans of the product. This meant putting less emphasis on glossy visuals, and placing more importance on interactions.</p>
			<p>Whilst carefully balancing my design intentions with technical scope, I produced a number of interactive prototypes which were user-tested, refined, documented and built &mdash; a process I saw from concept to completion.</p>

			<p class="caption"><strong>Above/</strong> Though seemingly-simple pieces of UI, even the text editor and delete controls went through numerous rounds of testing and iteration to perfect</p>

			<h5>Introducing Canvas</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> The journey from selecting a design to adding and editing your own content</p>			
			<p>The outcome was an easy-to-use &ldquo;WYSIWYG&rdquo; product that allows users to design bespoke-looking emails that suited their content, without having to worry about the complexity of HTML. Users are rarely presented with errors, can format content how they want, and are able to see exactly what their email will look like at all times. Values true to my original design intentions.</p>
			<p>Today, Canvas (now simply called &lsquo;Email Builder&rsquo;) is a core product of the Campaign Monitor platform &mdash; and the visual language I originally designed is still used by the product team who continue to work on it.</p>
