			<h3>Skype</h3>
			<p class="info"><strong>Above:</strong> The Skype app (OS X) featuring 12 icons I designed</p>
			<p>Working in-house with the Skype design teams in London and Estonia, I designed the icon suite currently used in all Skype applications - including their <a href="http://skype.com">global website</a> and iPhone app.</p>
			<p>The brief was to design a family of icons that were recognisably Skype, and were scalable enough to work across multiple platforms and sizes.</p>
			
			<div class="image"><img src="../_images/skype/arrows.png" width="100%" /></div>
			<p class="caption"><strong>Above &amp; below/</strong> A small selection of the icons in the suite. All of them follow a strict grid and rate-of-curve, which help them all appear visually similar.</p>

			<h5>Designing to a grid</h5>
			<p class="info"><strong>Below/</strong> Every icon was constructed using strict guidelines defining alignment, angle and rate of curve</p>
			<p>Due to the multi-platform requirements of these icons - they had to work everywhere, in every size. To ensure that they could be scaled up and down without losing quality or character, they were designed to a very strict grid and rate-of-curve. This meant they look correct anywhere from 8x8px, right up to retina and the sizes required for HD TV's and tablets.</p>
			
			<p>Each glyph was constructed to an 8x8 grid, with each point snapped to an axis. The rate of curve was enforced by drawing with circles divisible by 2 in diameter, though most icons followed a uniform 225px-diameter curve. Angles were kept at 7.5&deg;, 15&deg; or 30&deg;.</p>
