			<h1>Sphere of Influence</h1>
			<p class="lead">I’ve worked within big creative in-house teams for almost my entire career — <a href="#">immersed in inspiration</a>, deadlines, questionable music and shared illness, and surrounded by people who make me better at my craft by physical association. That all changed when I took my current position as a designer at Help Scout, a fully remote team — and in the years since I’ve been re-learning how to be a designer (and how to be productive, creative and collaborative) when there’s no-one else around.</p>
			<p>To make <a href="#">things</a> even more interesting, I also work in a different hemisphere to most of my team (I work from my home <span class="texter">studio in Australia</span>, whereas the majority of the design team are in North America) — which means that almost all of my communication happens asynchronously, since my day is their night <span class="bullet"></span></p>
			<p class="highlight">But after some trial and error, and with the support of my team — I now feel just as inspired, collaborative and inclusive working remotely as I ever did in an office.</p>

			<p>Sharing designs and gathering feedback is a critical part of any design role, remote or otherwise — yet there’s some magic lost when posting flat JPGs to Slack. Context is lost, words are overlooked and the level of detail or feedback required isn’t immediately obvious.</p>
