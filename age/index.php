			<h3>So far&hellip;</h3>
			
			<p class="lead">I left home when I was 16, lived with a friend a sailed professionally with the sponsorship of the Royal Navy for several years. I travelled a lot, slept mostly in a car, and ended up living in the Mediterranean teaching at a sailing school. I also finished high-school during that period, splitting my time evenly between school and sailing. Because all my school exams were modular, I was able to complete my subjects in one or two months, then travel the rest of the time.</p>
			
			<h6>University</h6>
			<p>Having applied from a beach in Turkey, I returned to the UK and started university at age 18. On the application, the university expected qualifications that would require another year or more of study &mdash; so I just said I did, and was accepted anyway. Avoiding extra study means that I was a couple of years ahead of my peers, making me the youngest on the course.</p>
				
			<p>In my first year of uni, similar to my high-school days, I spent half my first year in the UK and the second half back in the Med, teaching &mdash; then gave up sailing for good. In my second year of uni I did an unpaid internship at a small design agency, then in my third I started doing my own freelance design work under the &ldquo;company&rdquo; name Buzzgraphics. The design I did on the side paid my rent and gave me commercial work to put in my portfolio. It was also enough to allow me return to work for the agency I had interned at previously, but this time as a paid junior.</p>
			
			<p>At the end of my degree, during my final show I got into an argument with a visiting Creative Director from London who thought my work was shit, I disagreed. We argued for a while, and he ended up giving me a job, starting the day after my degree ended. So my girlfriend and I moved to a shared house in the outskirts of London, with no belongings and started working for less than the cost of travelling to work.</p>
			
			<h6>London</h6>
			<p>My first experience of agency life was a baptism of fire. As one of only three in the company, I rarely went home &mdash; designing for a multitude of diciplines, from branding to print and PR, then liasing with clients directly. It was fun, but I really wanted to spend more time doing digital design, but didn't have enough experience to be represented by any reputable recruiters. After a year of work, I managed to score an interview at a top digital agency by calling in a favour from a client &mdash; I didn't have much experience, but I got the job.</p>

			<p>Because I was used to working with clients from the time at my previous agency, I ended up being given much bigger, more client-facing jobs. I regularly flew overseas to pitch, run workshops and work with clients &mdash; at only 23, it was a tough learning experience. But by the time the agency was bought by a larger agency, people assumed my seniority based on the work I'd done, so I continued as a senior designer/art director. It was at this point that I started leading my own team, and when I stopped telling people my age.</p>

			<p>During the time spent in London, I had also been continuing my freelance work, serving bigger clients I'd met as a result of working at agencies&hellip; it meant working evening and weekends, but helped pay the rent. As my freelance work became increasingly digital, I had also started building a small app to help me present that work to my clients, which I called Prevue.</p>

			<p>The month the recession hit the UK, I decided to leave my job. My role had shifted into more management than design, and I felt that I needed a new creative challenge. It was arguably a risky move for a 24 year old &mdash; but fortunately as soon as announcing my resignation, I was approached to be represented by one of the recruiters who'd rejected me several years earlier. They kept the work coming thick and fast, so I set up a registered company, and began working for myself. I did hundreds of design jobs in various disciplines, and also a few longer in-house jobs as Art Director for companies like Skype, and one 3 month contract in Australia as a short-term Creative Director.</p>

			<h6>Sydney</h6>

			<p>After just a brief time in Australia, my fianc√© and I decided to leave London and emigrate. London was cool, but we were exhausted. So we sold everything we owned and moved to Sydney, where I took a position at an agency that offered a permanent visa. For a while, I stopped chasing titles and focussed on lifestyle instead of career &mdash; which meant selling my company in the UK, and stopping freelance altogether.</p>

			<p>After almost a year in Sydney, I was approached by a software firm who asked whether I'd consider helping them grow their design presence. Though initially hesitant to work "client-side", I accepted a role as Creative Director, tempted by the prospect of building my own design team and progressing the product and visual design of the company.</p>

			<p>I worked there for 4 years. I built two design teams and was responsible for designing a number of high profile briefs, and art directing countless others. In parallel to working as Creative Director, I also spent most nights working on Prevue &mdash; which gave me a creative outlet as my role became increasingly management focussed. Over the course of four years, I turned Prevue from a side project into a profitable business used by over 20,000 &mdash; thanks largely to the things I'd learned whilst working at a startup.</p>
			
			<h6>Now</h6>
			<p>Four years later, and in a similar fashion to what happened in London, I've decided to leave my full-time role to find another creative challenge. For now, that challenge is to grow Prevue &mdash; but in reality, I don't really know what's next. I've spent 12 years chasing seniority, maybe it's time to slow down.</p>
			<p>I only just turned 30, afterall.</p>
